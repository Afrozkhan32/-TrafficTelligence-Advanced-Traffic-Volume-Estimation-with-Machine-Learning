🧠 Problem Statement
Traffic congestion has become a significant issue in urban areas, causing delays, pollution, and safety concerns. Traditional estimation methods are either outdated or inefficient. This project explores modern ML techniques to predict traffic volume accurately using sensor and weather data.

🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately estimate traffic volume using input features such as:

Temperature

Rain/Snow indicators

Holiday and weekday status

Time of the day and month

Weather conditions

🗂️ Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle (if applicable)

Attributes: Includes temporal, meteorological, and road status data

Target Variable: traffic_volume (numeric)

🛠️ Methodology
Data Cleaning

Removal of null values

Date-time formatting

Feature Engineering

Extraction of hour, month, weekday

Holiday and weather encoding

Data Visualization

Correlation heatmaps

Volume trends by hour/day/month

Modeling Techniques

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Hyperparameter Tuning

Applied on Decision Tree and Random Forest for better results

📊 Model Evaluation
Model	R² Score
Linear Regression	~0.36
Decision Tree Regressor	~0.65
Random Forest Regressor	~0.84

Random Forest performed the best with high accuracy and low error.

✅ Results
Achieved significant improvement in prediction accuracy using ensemble learning.

Visualizations revealed peak hours and holiday effects on traffic volume.

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Handling datetime conversions and extracting useful features.

Dealing with skewed data distribution.

Hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.

🚀 Future Scope
Integration with real-time traffic APIs for live prediction.

Deployment via Flask/Django for web-based traffic dashboards.

Testing with city-specific datasets for location-based models.
