## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traffic congestion has become a significant issue in urban areas, causing delays, pollution, and safety concerns. Traditional estimation methods are either outdated or inefficient. This project explores modern ML techniques to predict traffic volume accurately using sensor and weather data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately estimate traffic volume using input features such as:

* Temperature
* Rain/Snow indicators
* Holiday and weekday status
* Time of the day and month
* Weather conditions

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle (if applicable)
* **Attributes:** Includes temporal, meteorological, and road status data
* **Target Variable:** `traffic_volume` (numeric)

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removal of null values
   * Date-time formatting

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extraction of hour, month, weekday
   * Holiday and weather encoding

3. **Data Visualization**

   * Correlation heatmaps
   * Volume trends by hour/day/month

4. **Modeling Techniques**

   * Linear Regression
   * Decision Tree Regressor
   * Random Forest Regressor

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

   * Applied on Decision Tree and Random Forest for better results

## 📊 Model Evaluation

| Model                   | R² Score |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Linear Regression       | \~0.36   |
| Decision Tree Regressor | \~0.65   |
| Random Forest Regressor | \~0.84   |

* **Random Forest** performed the best with high accuracy and low error.

---

## ✅ Results

* Achieved significant improvement in prediction accuracy using ensemble learning.
* Visualizations revealed peak hours and holiday effects on traffic volume.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* Handling datetime conversions and extracting useful features.
* Dealing with skewed data distribution.
* Hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Integration with real-time traffic APIs for live prediction.
* Deployment via Flask/Django for web-based traffic dashboards.
* Testing with city-specific datasets for location-based models.
